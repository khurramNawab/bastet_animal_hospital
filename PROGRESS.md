# Project Progress

## Done

- Initialized Git repository and set up `chore/setup` branch.
- Created `AGENTS.md` (< 150 lines) and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Created `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, and `.claude/settings.json`.
- Configured Next.js 14, TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`), and Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.ts`) with Bastet brand tokens.
- Set up Vitest test framework (`vitest.config.ts`, `tests/sample.test.ts`).
- Configured Prettier, ESLint, lint-staged, Husky pre-commit hooks, and GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Executed `npm run check` (Lint + Typecheck + Vitest) successfully with 0 errors.
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**:
  - Created `data/*.json` (site, doctors, services, animals, testimonials).
  - Created `lib/types.ts`, `lib/data.ts`, `lib/cn.ts`.
  - Configured luxury design tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` and `app/globals.css`.
  - Built `SmoothScroll` (Lenis + GSAP ticker + prefers-reduced-motion guard).
  - Built sticky glass `Navbar` with desktop underline indicator & accessible mobile drawer.
  - Built `Footer` with `GoldDivider`, OPD timings, and direct WhatsApp contact.
  - Configured root `app/layout.tsx` with Playfair Display + Inter Google Fonts.
  - Created placeholder `app/page.tsx` and route stubs (`/services`, `/doctors`, `/book`, `/tips`, `/contact`).
  - Added unit tests in `tests/data.test.ts` and `tests/cn.test.ts` (10 tests passing).
  - Successfully verified `npm run check` and `npm run build`.

## In Progress

- Awaiting confirmation to proceed to Phase 2.

## Next

- Phase 2: Hero Section + R3F 3D Model Canvas + Interactive Canine Viewport + GSAP Scroll animations.

## Decisions

- **Next.js 14 App Router**: Chosen for fast SSR, modern routing, and SEO optimization for the clinic's website.
- **Vitest + Testing Library**: Selected for fast native ESM test execution and component testing.
- **Tailwind with strict tokens**: Ensures unified design language matching Bastet luxury vet aesthetic (Teal, Gold, Cream, Ink).

## Known Issues

- None at setup stage.
